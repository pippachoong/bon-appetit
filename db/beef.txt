https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/46257452.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066

serves: 4

Cooking time: 2 hours

Ingredients
400 g stewing beef
4 cloves of garlic
4 cm piece of ginger
2 large onions
2 carrots
olive oil
2 tablespoons curry paste of your choice
250 g basmati rice
375 ml organic stock
12 curry leaves
natural yoghurt , optional
1 fresh red chilli , optional

Method
Get your ingredients out, then boil the kettle and place a medium lidded pan on a high heat, a frying pan on a high heat and a griddle pan on a high heat.
Fill the medium pan with boiling salted water.
Trim the end off the stalk from 1 head of broccoli, then cut up the head (like you see in the picture) and add to the pan, cover and boil for 4 minutes.
On a large sheet of greaseproof paper, toss 4 chicken breasts with salt, pepper and 1 heaped teaspoon of ground coriander, then fold the paper over and bash and flatten to 1.5cm thick with a rolling pin.
Put into the frying pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, turning after 3 or 4 minutes, until golden and cooked through.
With tongs, remove and drain the broccoli (leaving the pan of water on the heat), then place on the griddle until nicely charred.
Add 1 mug of bulgur wheat (300g) and 2 preserved lemons to the broccoli water and cover, stirring occasionally.
Halve or crush 1 bunch of radishes, trim and finely slice 2 spring onions and the top leafy half of ½ a bunch of fresh mint, then toss it all in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, and season to taste.
Drain the bulgur wheat and tip into a large serving bowl, then mash and mix in the preserved lemons and arrange the broccoli on top.
Toss 2 tablespoons of sunflower seeds in the chicken pan, then slice the chicken and add to the salad, scattering over the seeds and snipping over 1 punnet of cress.
Dollop over 4 tablespoons of natural yoghurt and drizzle with 2 teaspoons of harissa, then serve with lemon wedges on the side.

https://img.jamieoliver.com/jamieoliver/recipe-database/76647784.jpg?tr=w-800,h-1066

Serves: 4

Cooking time: 30 mins

Ingredients
320 g tenderstem broccoli
2 x 250 g lean flank steak
2 teaspoons coriander seeds
250 g medium free-range egg noodles
3 teaspoons sesame oil
1 red onion
2 cloves of garlic
6 cm piece of fresh ginger
olive oil
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 lime
1 fresh red chilli

Method
Trim the broccoli, cutting any larger broccoli stems in half lengthways, then place in a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Add a good pinch of sea salt and leave for 10 minutes, then drain and put to one side. Half-fill a pan with water and bring to the boil.
Slice the steaks against the grain into finger-sized strips and season with sea salt and black pepper.
Pound the coriander seeds in a pestle and mortar, or bash with the base of a pan, until fine. Sprinkle over the steak so they stick to it and give it a lovely, fragrant flavour.
Drop the noodles into the pan of boiling salted water and cook until just tender. Drain, then toss with 2 teaspoons of sesame oil and return to the pan. Cover to keep warm.
Peel and finely slice the onion and garlic, then peel and finely chop the ginger.
Heat a splash of olive oil in a wok or large frying pan over a high heat, then add the onions, garlic and ginger. Fry for a couple of minutes, or until the onions have softened slightly.
Add the seasoned pieces of steak and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes, then add the broccoli and fry for a further 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Pour in the soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, toss in the pan until everything is well coated, then serve with the egg noodles.
Cut the lime into wedges for squeezing over, and finely slice the chilli (deseed if you like), then sprinkle over the top.

400 g quality lean beef mince
olive oil
3 ripe tomatoes
5 cm piece of ginger
2 spring onions

2 heaped teaspoons Patak's rogan josh curry paste

Ingredients out • Kettle boiled • Large frying pan, high heat • Medium lidded casserole pan, high heat • Liquidizer

START COOKING
Put the lentils into a bowl with a pinch of sea salt, black pepper, the garam masala and mince, then mix and scrunch together with clean hands.

Divide the mixture in half, then with wet hands quickly squeeze and mould each half into 6 fat fingers. Put them into the frying pan with 1 tablespoon of oil, turning when golden.

Put 1 mug of rice, 2 mugs of boiling water and the cardamom pods into the casserole pan, then halve and add the beans and put the lid on.

Squash the tomatoes into the liquidizer, peel and add the ginger, and trim and add the spring onions. Add half the chilli, the coriander stalks, turmeric, honey, curry paste and coconut milk, then blitz until combined.

Pour into the kofta pan, bring to the boil, then simmer and season to taste.

Take the lid off the rice, add the peas, mix it all up and give it just a few more minutes.

Crack up the uncooked poppadoms and pop them in the microwave (800W) for a minute or two to puff up.

Finely slice the remaining chilli and the coriander leaves and scatter them over the curry, dollop with yoghurt, then serve with lemon wedges, poppadoms and the rice, beans and peas.
